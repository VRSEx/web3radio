# WEB3RADIO - The Voice of Web3
WEB3RADIO is a Decentralized Broadcast Network that intends to act as a platform that provides a voice to Web3 artists, musicians, citizen journalists, and enthusiasts.

Why should someone build this?
WEB3RADIO is a unique platform that combines the power of blockchain technology and music to create an ecosystem that benefits both artists and listeners.
With its focus on decentralized music and the potential for new revenue streams through cryptocurrency and NFTs, WEB3RADIO has the potential to disrupt the traditional music industry.
In addition, the incorporation of AI and machine learning could create a personalized listening experience for users, making WEB3RADIO a unique and valuable platform in the industry.
With the addition of the text-to-speech Chrome extension we can now incorporate ACE into our broadcasts, providing real-time translations in multiple languages and further enhancing the user experience.
# The Decentralization Station

**The decentralization revolution of tomorrow, starts today.**

*Introducing* **DeAd-NFTs**

The ADHD Project introduces DeAd-NFTs, a groundbreaking and innovative approach to supporting artists, projects, individuals, and businesses within the decentralized ecosystem. Our mission is to redefine the way we engage with advertising, affiliate marketing, empower content creators, and drive the future of decentralized media while ensuring transparency, integrity, & honor.

**What are DeAd-NFTs?**

DeAd-NFTs, which stands for Decentralized Advertisement Non-Fungible Tokens, are a revolutionary form of digital assets that blend the power of NFTs with the world of advertising and affiliate marketing. These tokens represent a new era in marketing and support, where community collaboration, creativity, and ownership intersect.

**Supporting the WEB3RADIO Revolution**

Our initial focus is on supporting WEB3RADIO, the Decentralization Station. By acquiring DeAd-NFTs, you directly contribute to the growth and sustainability of this groundbreaking project. Your support will help us continue to provide decentralized, community-driven content, while also giving you a unique opportunity to participate in the future of decentralized advertisement.

**How DeAd-NFTs Work**

When you purchase a DeAd-NFT, you are not just acquiring a digital collectible; you are investing in the future of decentralized media. Each DeAd-NFT can be transferred to the WEB3RADIO wallet for redemption of advertisements (ReAds). One DeAd-NFT equals one ReAd, which consists of a top-of-the-hour and bottom-of-the-hour advertisement announcement during our on-air/on-chain broadcasts and live events.

**Example:**

Top of the Hour (e.g., 12:00 PM):
"You're listening to WEB3RADIO - The Decentralization Station. This broadcast is brought to you in part by the Lonely Frog Lambo Club - The most historic frog collection on the Ethereum blockchain."

Bottom of the Hour (e.g., 12:30 PM):
"You're listening to WEB3RADIO - The Decentralization Station. This broadcast is brought to you in part by the Lonely Frog Lambo Club - The most historic frog collection on the Ethereum blockchain."

**Join Us in Shaping the Future**

The ADHD Project envisions a future where advertising is transparent, community-driven, and supportive of content creators. With DeAd-NFTs, we invite you to be a part of this transformation, supporting our mission to make the world of decentralized media more exciting, engaging, and equitable.

Together, we'll redefine advertising, empower creators, and take decentralization to the next level. Join us in this exciting journey as we revolutionize the way we support our projects and the creators behind them.


Iteration 1: Basic DeAd-NFTs

	1.	Choose the Blockchain: Determine which blockchain you want to deploy your DeAd-NFTs on. For simplicity, let’s consider Ethereum.
	2.	Develop the Smart Contract: Write the smart contract in Solidity (Ethereum’s programming language). The contract should include functions for minting, transferring, and redeeming DeAd-NFTs. You’ll also define the metadata for each DeAd-NFT, including the advertisement content.
	3.	Minting DeAd-NFTs: Implement a minting function that allows you to create new DeAd-NFTs. You can set limits on the total supply if needed.
	4.	Transferring DeAd-NFTs: Include a function that enables users to transfer their DeAd-NFTs to other addresses. This might involve the standard ERC-721 transfer functions.
	5.	Redeeming Advertisements: Users should be able to redeem their DeAd-NFTs for advertisements. Define a function that broadcasts the advertisement content associated with a specific DeAd-NFT at the designated times (top and bottom of the hour).
	6.	Testing: Thoroughly test the smart contract on a testnet to ensure all functions work correctly. Address any bugs or issues.

Iteration 2: Adding Affiliate Marketing

To introduce affiliate marketing, you’ll need to enhance the smart contract to track revenue sharing among DeAd-NFT holders:

	1.	Enhance the Smart Contract: Modify the smart contract to include revenue tracking. You’ll need to add mechanisms for recording revenue generated from advertisements or product sales.
	2.	Affiliate Marketing Logic: Implement the logic for affiliate marketing. This could involve a referral system where users can refer others to advertise or purchase products through their DeAd-NFT link.
	3.	Revenue Distribution: Define how revenue is distributed among DeAd-NFT holders. You might use a percentage-based system, where a portion of the revenue generated through referrals goes to the NFT owner and the referrer.
	4.	User Interface: Update the user interface to display referral links and earnings. Users should be able to track their affiliate marketing performance.
	5.	Testing: Test the enhanced smart contract on a testnet to ensure that revenue tracking and distribution work as intended.
	6.	Deployment: Deploy the updated smart contract on your chosen blockchain.
